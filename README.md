BackboneCommerce is a full stack Content Management System focussed on selling your product online.
It is free, well structured and scaleable.

To simplify the process of setting up a unique selling point, BackboneCommerce features a template System.
Templates are written in Jade and can be altered with little knowledge in HTML and CSS, no further coding needed.
A CLI is included to generate new pages easy and fast.

You can try this live on your browser and see some examples. Check out [Särkower](https://särkower.de).

We currently support and maintain [these examples](https://) (Särkower, ...), please feel free to contact me and get your business going.
