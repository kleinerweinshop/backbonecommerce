BackboneCommerce is a full stack content management system focussed on selling your products.
It is free to use, structured and scaleable.

To simplify the process of setting up a selling point, BackboneCommerce features a template System.
Templates are written in Jade and can be altered with little knowledge in HTML and CSS, no further coding needed.
A CLI is included to generate new pages easy and fast

You can try this live on your browser and see some examples. Check out [Särkower](https://särkower.de).
