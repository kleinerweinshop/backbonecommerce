BackboneCommerce is a full stack Content Management System focussed on selling your product online.
It is free, well structured and scaleable.

This CMS contains SINGLE PAGE CLIENT Structure on top of a fast and reliable NODEJS Webserver supported by the document-based MONGO Database.
To simplify the process of setting up and customizing, the CMS features a TEMPLATE SYSTEM.
Templates are written in PUG(HTML) and can be altered with little knowledge in HTML and CSS, no further coding needed.
A CLI is included to generate new pages easy and fast.

You can try this live EXAMPLE in your browser. Check out [Särkower.de](https://särkower.de).
